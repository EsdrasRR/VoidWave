# VoidWave

A lightweight HTML5 + Canvas prototype for a pixel‑art space survival game. You control a small ship using **WASD** or the **arrow keys**, navigating a Stardew‑Valley‑inspired pixel art universe. Enemies will spawn in waves, chasing the player in a vampire‑survivors style.

## Features
- HTML5 Canvas core loop (render + update)
- WASD / Arrow key movement
- Pixel‑art friendly scaling (no blur)
- Simple player placeholder sprite (to be replaced later)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/space-vampire-survival.git
cd space-vampire-survival
